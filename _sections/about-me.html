<p> I recently graduated from UNCC with a BS in Computer Science.</br>
I am seeking a new company to be my home where I can meet new a family of fellow geeks.</br>
We can bond over video games, tabletop games, the great outdoors, or pets.</br>
I am in this transitional period where I cannot decide whether or not I am a cat or dog person.</br>

My coursework at UNCC focused on making applications, AI, websites, and video games.</br>
I am open to making all kinds of software. I enjoy doing it, as it stimulates my need to solve problems.</br>
I also love feedback on my performance, so that I can get better at what I do.
