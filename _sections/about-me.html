<p> I am currently a Computer Science major with a concentration in AI, robotics, and gaming
    at UNC Charlotte in North Carolina. My anticipated graduation is December 2020.<br />
    I love to use kanban boards to organize my projects. I typically use Trello, but I have used Asana.</p>
    I have a very thorough problem solving process. It is how I learn best. Ask me about it!<br />
