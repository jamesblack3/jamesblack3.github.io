<p> I am currently a Computer Science major with a concentration in AI, robotics, and gaming
    at UNC Charlotte in North Carolina. My anticipated graduation is December 2020.<br />
    My passion is easy to read and bug free code that I can be proud of.<br />
    I love to build modular systems that work well so that I don't have to redo code. <br />
    I build video games in my free time as a creative outlet.
