<p> I am currently a Computer Science major with a concentration in AI, robotics, and gaming
    at UNC Charlotte in North Carolina. My anticipated graduation is Winter 2020.<br />
    When I work, I typically start with a simple start and finsh, then I iterate on it.<br />
    I love to use kanban boards to organize my projects; most of my projects use them, typically Trello.</p>
